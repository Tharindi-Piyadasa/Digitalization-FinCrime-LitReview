# Research Gaps in AI for AML

- Lack of focus on Explainable AI (XAI) for justifiable decisions
- Ethical concerns and bias mitigation are underexplored
- Scalability and interoperability challenges in cloud AML solutions
- Risk of over-reliance on AI reducing human oversight
- Limited research on AI-Blockchain integration
- Need for development of fairness audits and interpretability standards
- Scarcity of original empirical studies
- Emerging areas like Quantum AI and Adversarial AI lack depth
